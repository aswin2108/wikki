                    <p class="jobs-para-1-content-p">
                        Born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California, Steve Jobs faced a tumultuous childhood marked by adoption, 
                        academic challenges, and an unrelenting spirit. Raised in a working-class family, he discovered his love for electronics 
                        during high school. However, his unconventional path led him to drop out of college, facing financial hardships that forced 
                        him to rely on friends' generosity. These early struggles shaped Jobs' resilience and determination, laying the foundation 
                        for his future endeavors.

                    <p class="jobs-para-2-content-p">
                        In 1976, Jobs co-founded Apple Computer, alongside Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, in his parents' garage. This momentous venture 
                        revolutionized the tech industry, introducing the Apple I and later the Macintosh, transforming personal computing. Despite initial 
                        successes, internal conflicts led to Jobs leaving Apple in 1985. Undeterred, he ventured into NeXT and Pixar, achieving success in 
                        the computer and animation industries. Jobs' entrepreneurial journey demonstrated his ability to innovate and redefine industries.

                        Jobs' return to Apple in 1997 marked a pivotal moment. With the introduction of iconic products like the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad, 
                        he steered Apple to unprecedented success. His visionary leadership, emphasis on design, and commitment to simplicity reshaped consumer 
                        electronics. Despite a battle with pancreatic cancer, Jobs continued to lead Apple until his resignation in 2011. His last years were 
                        marked by dedication to his work, unveiling groundbreaking products like the iPhone 4S before his passing on October 5, 2011.
